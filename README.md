# HR ANALYTICS


HR analytics, also referred to as people analytics, workforce analytics, or talent analytics, involves gathering together, analyzing, and reporting HR data. It enables your organization to measure the impact of a range of HR metrics on overall business performance and make decisions based on data. In other words, HR analytics is a data-driven approach toward Human Resources Management.

# How does HR Analytics work?

HR Analytics is made up of several components that feed into each other.

1. To gain the problem-solving insights that HR Analytics promises, data must first be collected.

2. The data then needs to be monitored and measured against other data, such as historical information, norms or averages.

3. This helps identify trends or patterns. It is at this point that the results can be analyzed at the analytical stage.

4. The final step is to apply insight to organizational decisions.

# How does it work?

Advanced statistical techniques are used to create algorithmic models capable of identifying trends and future behaviors. These future trends can describe possible risks or opportunities that organizations can leverage in long-term decision-making.

# My Work on this Project:

what insights the HR wants to see from the data??

1. Understand the working preference of the people between work from home and work from office?

2. People are taking sick leave so we should know why people are taking sick leaves generally covid and other seasonal flues (No. of people being sick on a given period of time in the year.

3. Total percentage of people present (P), Percentage of people taking sick leave (SL) and percentage of people love to work from home(WFH) .

4. Analysing trends of presence % by date, Sick leave % by date and Work from home (WFH %) by date by using visual charts.

5. Created a matrix table w.r.t days of week and presence %, days of week and work fropm home percentage (WFH %) and at last days of week and sick leave percentage(SL %).

6. We have created a table of the employees where the columns are name of the employees, presence %, Work from home (WFH %) and sick leave percentage (SL%) which can help us to understand details w.r.t Presence percentage, SL and WFH by each person in details.

7. We have created a table which gives the details of the employees w.r.t each day.

# what we have done in the Hr analytics project:

1. importing the data.

2. importing the april data.

3. we promoted the headers.

4. we did some unpivoting i.e. the transformation step.

5. gather and transform data using Power Query.

6. create metrics using DAX.

7. create a usable dashboard.

8. future requirements of stakeholders after providing a MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

## ðŸ›  Skills
MySql, PowerBi(DAX, Power Query)

## Lessons Learned

Asking right questions to the client to understand their short and long term plans and allign my solution accordingly. 
I faced the problem while understanding the data as it was unstructured i.e. the header was not prompted so it took a little time to understand and prompt the headers.
